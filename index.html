        <ul>
          <li>Between 1989 and 1990, English scientist Tim Berners-Lee wrote the first specification for the HTML language along with the client and server software to make it run while being employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland</li>
          <li>HTML is a markup language and it was originally intended to enrich plain text documents with hypertext (hyperlinks to other documents)</li>
          <li>HTML markup consists of tags that define HTML elements, which, nested in a strict hierarchical structure, compose the HTML document</li>
          <li>HTML1 defined around 20 tags which were strictly intended for representing different types of text content and relationships between documents</li>
          <li>Currently HTML features tags for text, multimedia, inputs and page structure, and also supports semantic markup</li>

          <li>Mosaic was the first browser to allow images embedded in text and it became the world's first most popular browser</li>
          <li>Netscape Navigator, released in 1994, was inspired by the success of the Mosaic browser</li>
          <li>There was an intense period of competition between Netscape and Microsoft for dominance of the market in the 90s, which is also known as "The Browser Wars"</li>

          <li>Before CSS was proposed in 1994 by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, there had been different attempt to implement styling by the different browser manufacturers</li>
          <li>Although by the end of 1996 the CSS specification finally achieved its current form, the first browser which featured CSS Level 1 support was Internet Explorer 5 for MAcintosh, shipped in 2002</li>
